fix scene stack/manager - options menu should always return to the previous scene
-- kind of fixed, maybe can do bottom up instead of top down -- maybe have the map only have one tile per cell
	A given TileMap needs to have all tilesets used be the same size.  Jonah needs to fix test_world_01.tmx
There is a pause before the Start Menu scene is displayed, maybe do a loading splash screen?.
There is a pause before input is handled, is this real or perceived?.
